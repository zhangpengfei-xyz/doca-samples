# Test the compilation of the publicly installed DOCA SDK samples
#
# Usage:
#     ./compile_public_samples.sh ([list_of_libraries.txt])
#
# An optional parameter can specify a desired SUBSET of DOCA SDK libraries to be
# tested. An example for such a file that focuses on a random subset of DOCA SDK
# libraries is the following:
# "
# doca_aes_gcm
# doca_compress
# doca_dma
# "
#
# Note:
# If a list of libraries isn't provided, ALL samples will be built.
# If environment variable SAMPLES_FOLDER_PATH is set, will use this folder to derive all applications list
# Examples:
#  1. Test the build of ALL samples:
#         ./compile_public_samples.sh
#  2. Test the build of only a selected set of DOCA SDK libraries:
#         ./compile_public_samples.sh doca_networking_libraries.txt
