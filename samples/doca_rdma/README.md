# DOCA RDMA

Each sample presents a connection between two peers, transferring data from one to another, using a different RDMA operation in each sample. For more information on the available RDMA operations, refer to section  ["Tasks"](https://docs.nvidia.com/doca/archive/2-9-0/doca+rdma/index.html#src-3113769286_id-.DOCARDMAv2.9.0LTS-Tasks).

Each sample is comprised of two executables, each running on a peer.

The samples can run on either DPU or host, as long as the chosen peers have a connection between them.

> **Note:** Prior to running the samples, ensure that the chosen devices, selected by the device name and the GID index, are set correctly and have a connection between one another. In each sample, it is the user's responsibility to copy the descriptors between the peers.

## General Sample Steps

Most of the samples follow the following main basic steps:

### Allocating Resources

1. Locating and opening a device. The chosen device is one that supports the tasks relevant for the sample. If the sample requires no task, any device may be chosen.
2. Creating a local MMAP and configuring it (including setting the MMAP memory range and relevant permissions).
3. Creating a DOCA PE.
4. Creating an RDMA instance and configuring it (including setting the relevant permissions).
5. Connecting the RDMA context to the PE.

### Sample-Specific Configurations

1. Configuring the tasks relevant to the sample, if any. Including:
   - Setting the number of tasks for each task type.
   - Setting callback functions for each task type, with the following logic:
     - **Successful completion callback:**
       - Verifying the data received from the remote, if any, is valid.
       - Printing the transferred data.
       - Freeing the task and task-specific resources (such as source/destination buffers).
       - If an error occurs in steps a. and b., update the error that was encountered.
     - **Failed completion callback:**
       - Update the error that was encountered.
       - Freeing the task and task-specific resources (such as source/destination buffers).
   - Decreasing the number of remaining tasks and stopping the context once it reaches 0.
2. Setting a state change callback function, with the following logic:
   - Once the context moves to Starting state (can only be reached from Idle), export and connect the RDMA and, in some samples, export the local mmap or the sync event.
   - Once the context moves to Running state (can only be reached from Starting state in RDMA samples):
     - In some samples, only print a log and wait for the peer, or synchronize events.
     - In other samples, prepare and submit a task:
       - If needed, create an mmap from the received exported mmap descriptor, passed from the peer.
       - Request the required buffers from the buffer inventory.
       - Allocate and initiate the required task, together with setting the number of remaining tasks parameter as the task's user data.
       - Submit the task.
   - Once the context moves to Stopping state, print a relevant log.
   - Once the context moves to Idle state:
     - Print a relevant log.
     - Send update that the main loop may be stopped.
3. Setting the program's resources as the context user data to be used in callbacks.
4. Creating a buffer inventory and starting it.
5. Starting the context.

> **Info:** After starting the context, the state change callback function is called by the PE which executes the relevant steps.

> **Info:** In a successful run, each section is executed in the order they are presented in section 2.b.

### Progressing the PE

Progressing the PE until the context returns to Idle state and the main loop may be stopped, either because of a run in which all tasks have been completed, or due to a fatal error.

  - For this task, the successful task completion callback has the following logic:
    - Printing an info log saying the task was successfully completed and a specific successful completion log for the task.
    - Decreasing the number of remaining tasks. Once 0 is reached:
      - Freeing the task and task-specific resources.
      - Stopping the context.
  - For this task, the failed task completion callback stops the context even when the number of remaining tasks is different than 0 (since the synchronization between the peers would fail).
- A "remote net sync event get" task is configured for this sample.
  - For this task, the successful task completion callback also includes:
    - Resubmitting the task, until a value greater than or equal to the expected value is retrieved.
    - Once such value is retrieved, submitting a "remote net sync event notify set" task to signal sample completion, including:
      - Updating the successful completion message accordingly.
      - Increasing the number of submitted tasks.
    - If an error was encountered, and the "remote net sync event notify set" task was not submitted, the task and task resources are freed.
  - For this task, the failed task completion callback also includes freeing the "remote net sync event notify set" task and task resources.
- The local mmap is not exported as the peer does not intend to access it.
- No remote mmap is created as there is no intention to access the remote memory in this sample.
- To synchronize events with the peer, a sync event remote net is created from the peer's exported sync event.
- Both tasks are prepared and submitted in the state change callback, once the context moves from starting to running.
- The user data of the "remote net sync event get" task points to the "remote net sync event notify set" task.

- This sample includes creating a local sync event and exporting it to the remote memory to allow the peer to create a remote handle.
- No tasks are configured for this sample, and thus no tasks are prepared and submitted, nor are there task completion callbacks. In this sample, the following steps are executed once the context moves from starting to running, using the state change callback:
  - Waiting for the sync event to be signaled from the remote side.
  - Notifying the sync event from the local side.
  - Waiting for completion notification from the remote side.

# RDMA Multi-connections Send and Receive

The following samples illustrate how multiple connections can be performed to demonstrate an exchange of messages between peers.

Please note, using DOCA RDMA CM flow (see section ["Connecting Using RDMA CM Connection Flow"](https://docs.nvidia.com/doca/archive/2-9-0/doca+rdma/index.html#src-3113769286_id-.DOCARDMAv2.9.0LTS-ConnectingUsingRDMACMConnectionFlow)):
