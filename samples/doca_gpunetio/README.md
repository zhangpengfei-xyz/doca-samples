# GPUNetIO Samples

This section contains two samples that show how to enable simple GPUNetIO features.

Be sure to correctly set the following environment variables:

## Build the sample

```plaintext
export PATH=${PATH}:/usr/local/cuda/bin
export CPATH="$(echo /usr/local/cuda/targets/{x86_64,sbsa}-linux/include | sed 's/ /:/'):${CPATH}"
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=${PKG_CONFIG_PATH}:/usr/lib/pkgconfig:/opt/mellanox/grpc/lib/{x86_64,aarch64}-linux-gnu/pkgconfig:/opt/mellanox/dpdk/lib/{x86_64,aarch64}-linux-gnu/pkgconfig:/opt/mellanox/doca/lib/{x86_64,aarch64}-linux-gnu/pkgconfig
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/usr/local/cuda/lib64:/opt/mellanox/gdrcopy/src:/opt/mellanox/dpdk/lib/{x86_64,aarch64}-linux-gnu:/opt/mellanox/doca/lib/{x86_64,aarch64}-linux-gnu
```

## Info

    All the DOCA samples described in this section are governed under the BSD-3 software license agreement.

## Note

    Please ensure the arch of your GPU is included in the meson.build file before building the samples (e.g., sm_80 for Ampere, sm_89 for L40, sm_90 for H100, etc).

## Ethernet Send Wait Time

The sample shows how to enable Accurate Send Scheduling (or wait-on-time) in the context of a GPUNetIO application. Accurate Send Scheduling is the ability of an NVIDIA NIC to send packets in the future according to application-provided timestamps.

> **Note:** This feature is supported on ConnectX-6 Dx and later.

## Info

This NVIDIA blog post offers an example for how this feature has been used in 5G networks.

This DOCA GPUNetIO sample provides a simple application to send packets with Accurate Send Scheduling from the GPU.

## Synchronizing Clocks

Before starting the sample, it is important to properly synchronize the CPU clock with the NIC clock. This way, timestamps provided by the system clock are synchronized with the time in the NIC.

For this purpose, at least the phc2sys service must be used. To install it on an Ubuntu system:


## phc2sys

```plaintext
sudo apt install linuxptp
```
To start the phc2sys service properly, a config file must be created in /lib/systemd/system/phc2sys.service:

## phc2sys

```plaintext
[Unit]
Description=Synchronize system clock or PTP hardware clock (PHC)
Documentation=man:phc2sys
 
[Service]
Restart=always
RestartSec=5s
Type=simple
ExecStart=/bin/sh -c "taskset -c 15 /usr/sbin/phc2sys -s /dev/ptp$(ethtool -T ens6f0 | grep PTP | awk '{print $4}') -c CLOCK_REALTIME -n 24 -O 0 -R 256 -u 256"
 
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
Now phc2sys service can be started:

## phc2sys

```plaintext
sudo systemctl stop systemd-timesyncd
sudo systemctl disable systemd-timesyncd
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start phc2sys.service
```

To check the status of phc2sys:

## phc2sys

```plaintext
$ sudo systemctl status phc2sys.service

```

At this point, the system and NIC clocks are synchronized so timestamps provided by the CPU are correctly interpreted by the NIC.

> **Warning:** The timestamps you get may not reflect the real time and day. To get that, you must properly set the ptp4l service with an external grand master on the system. Doing that is out of the scope of this sample.

## Running the Sample

The sample is shipped with the source files that must be built:
## phc2sys
```plaintext
# Ensure DOCA and DPDK are in the pkgconfig environment variable
cd /opt/mellanox/doca/samples/doca_gpunetio/gpunetio_send_wait_time
meson build
ninja -C build
```
The sample sends 8 bursts of 32 raw Ethernet packets or 1kB to a dummy Ethernet address, 10:11:12:13:14:15, in a timed way. Program the NIC to send every t nanoseconds (command line option -t).

The following example programs a system with GPU PCIe address ca:00.0 and NIC PCIe address 17:00.0 to send 32 packets every 5 milliseconds:

## Run

```
To verify that packets are actually sent at the right time, use a packet sniffer on the other side (e.g., tcpdump):
## phc2sys
```plaintext
$ sudo tcpdump -i enp23s0f1np1 -A -s 64
 
17:12:23.480318 IP5 (invalid)
Sent from DOCA GPUNetIO...........................
....
17:12:23.480368 IP5 (invalid)
Sent from DOCA GPUNetIO...........................
# end of first burst of 32 packets, bump to +5ms
17:12:23.485321 IP5 (invalid)
Sent from DOCA GPUNetIO...........................
...
17:12:23.485369 IP5 (invalid)
Sent from DOCA GPUNetIO...........................
# end of second burst of 32 packets, bump to +5ms
17:12:23.490278 IP5 (invalid)
Sent from DOCA GPUNetIO...........................
...
```

The output should show a jump of approximately 5 milliseconds every 32 packets.

## Note

- `tcpdump` may increase latency in sniffing packets and reporting the receive timestamp. As a result, the difference between bursts of 32 packets reported may be less than expected, especially with small interval times like 500 microseconds (`-t 500000`).

## Warning

- Invoking a `printf` from a CUDA kernel is not good practice for release software. It should only be used to print debug information, as it slows down the overall execution of the CUDA kernel.

## To Build and Run the Application
```plaintext
# Ensure DOCA and DPDK are in the pkgconfig environment variable
cd /opt/mellanox/doca/samples/doca_gpunetio/gpunetio_simple_receive
meson build
ninja -C build
```

To test the application, this guide assumes the usual setup with two machines: one with the DOCA receiver application and the second one acting as packet generator. As UDP packet generator, this example considers the nping application that can be easily installed easily on any Linux machine.

The command to send 10 UDP packets via nping on the packet generator machine is:

## nping generator
```plaintext
$ nping --udp -c 10 -p 2090 192.168.1.1 --data-length 1024 --delay 500ms

```

Assuming the DOCA Simple Receive sample is waiting on the other machine at IP address 192.168.1.1.

The DOCA Simple Receive sample is launched on a system with NIC at 17:00.1 PCIe address and GPU at ca:00.0 PCIe address:

## RDMA Client Server
This sample exhibits how to use the GPUNetIO RDMA API to receive and send/write with immediate using a single RDMA queue.

The server has a GPU buffer array A composed by GPU_BUF_NUM doca_gpu_buf elements, each 1kB in size. The client has two GPU buffer arrays, B and C, each composed by GPU_BUF_NUM doca_gpu_buf elements, each 512B in size.

The goal is for the client to fill a single server buffer of 1kB with two GPU buffers of 512B as illustrated in the following figure:
![](server_buffer.jpg)

To show how to use RDMA write and send, even buffers are sent from the client with write immediate, while odd buffers are sent with send immediate. In both cases, the server must pre-post the RDMA receive operations.

For each buffer, the CUDA kernel code repeats the handshake:

![](handshake.png)
Once all buffers are filled, the server double checks that all values are valid. The server output should be as follows:

## Note

    With RDMA, the network device must be specified by name (e.g., mlx5_0 ) instead of the PCIe address (as is the case for Ethernet).

It is also possible to enable the RDMA CM mode, establishing two connections with the same RDMA GPU handler. An example on the client side:

In case of RDMA CM, the command option -cm must be specified on the server side.

> **Warning:** Printing from a CUDA kernel is not recommended for performance. It may make sense for debugging purposes and for simple samples like this one.

## GPU DMA Copy
This sample exhibits how to use the DOCA DMA and DOCA GPUNetIO libraries to DMA copy a memory buffer from the CPU to the GPU (with DOCA DMA CPU functions) and from the GPU to the CPU (with DOCA GPUNetIO DMA device functions) from a CUDA kernel. This sample requires a DPU as it uses the DMA engine on it.
